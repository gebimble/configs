welcome to ye olde .vimrc
=========================

preamble
--------

Let's start with the basic stuff:

Set your leader key! *Muy importante*.
~~~
let mapleader=" "
~~~

Set line numbering, and the number of columns that those numbers can occupy on
the left of the vim window
~~~
set nu
set numberwidth=10
~~~

Make vim **non-compatible**. We want it to be more useful than `vi`!
~~~
set nocompatible
~~~

Set filetype detection to 'off'
~~~
filetype off
~~~

Add the fuzzyfinder to the runtime path (helpful for, y'know, using the
fuzzyfinder...)
~~~
set rtp+=~/.fzf
~~~

plugin stuff
============

I use the wonderful `vim-plug`. It's easy, has a pleasant gui-like aspect to
it, and can install things concurrently! God bless
[junegunn](https://github.com/junegunn).

installing vim-plug
-------------------

Make sure you've got curl installed

>`sudo apt-get install curl`

and then slap all this into your command line

>`curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
>   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim`

and then you're in, and you can get your delicious, personalised freak on...

plugins
-------

Everything between `call plug#begin`... and `call plug#end` forces `vim-plug`
to try and interpret something following a `Plug` command as a potential
plugin, and it'll try and fetch it from [Github](https://github.com) and then
manipulate it for your delectation.

~~~
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
~~~

[SimpylFold](https://github.com/tmhedberg/SimpylFold)

plugin for the filetype, and its indent expressions are loaded.

~~~
filetype plugin indent on
filetype plugin on
~~~

Colourscheme Choices
====================

Solarized or Zenburn! Delicious stuffffff.

if has('gui_running')
    set background=dark

Point to the correct Python library for Completor to use.

nnoremap <C-k> <C-w><C-k>
nnoremap <C-l> <C-w><C-l>
nnoremap <C-h> <C-w><C-h>

I can't remember what this stuff does?

I'm not sure whether or not I need this anymore. It possibly even causes some
conflict.

TODO: Look at this when you've got more time.
